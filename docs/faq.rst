Inclusion Criteria
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Similarly to Similarly to scikit-learn, We mainly consider well-established algorithms for inclusion.

However, we encourage the author(s) of newly proposed models to share and add your implementation into combo
for boosting ML accessibility and reproducibility.
This exception only applies if you could commit to the maintenance of your model for at least two year period.
